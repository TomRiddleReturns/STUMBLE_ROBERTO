        <img src="ron.jpg" alt="My Photo" />
        <p> Hey, I’m Stable Ronaldo — and no, I’m not actually stable. I scream louder than your alarm clock, cry harder
            than your ex after a Fortnite loss, and somehow still manage to clutch games with 2 brain cells and pure
            chaos.I do IRL streams and reactions, but mostly I just scream at the screen like it owes me money. If
            there’s drama, I’m reacting to it. If there’s chaos, I’m probably causing it. I laugh, cry, overreact, and
            somehow turn everything into content.</p>
